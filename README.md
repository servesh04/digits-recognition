# Digit Recognition

## Project Overview
This project uses the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits (0 through 9). The neural network model includes the following layers:
- **Flatten** layer to convert 28x28 images into a 1D array.
- **Dense** (fully connected) layers with ReLU activation.
- **Dense** output layer with softmax activation for classification.
